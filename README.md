## Task

Imagine you're on a project and this code was the check-in by another member of your team.  You've been asked by the team to perform a code review of both the server and client.

1. Can you see any issues with this code and if so, can you put together a list of changes you would want before approving the code for production release.  

2. You've also noticed that no tests were written.  Can you suggest what tests you would write and how they might be structured?

NOTE: We don't expect you to write any code or tests, just dot point in a document what changes you would make to the code and explain the process for each of the tests in as much detail as possible.

## Commands to run:

If you're interested in running the code.

Please run "npm install" after cloning the project to install the node modules.

- npm run start - starts local server
