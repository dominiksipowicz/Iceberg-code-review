## Task

Imagine you're on a project and this code was the check-in by another member of your team.  You've been asked by the team to perform a code review of both the server and client.

1. Can you see any issues with this code and if so, can you put together a list of changes you would want before approving the code for production release.
NOTE: We don't expect you to rewrite the code, just dot point in a document what changes you would make and where.

2. You've also noticed that no tests were written.  Can you suggest what tests you would write?
NOTE: You don't need to write the actual test, just the description and the process you would take for each test.

## Commands to run:

If you're interested in running the code.

Please run "npm install" after cloning the project to install the node modules.

- npm run start - starts local server
